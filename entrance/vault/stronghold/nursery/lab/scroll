An abandoned laboratory of a wizard long dead.

A lone magickal torch ignites as you enter, shedding
light on the workshop, and casts haunting shadows
on every surface.

The flames lick the walls, burning off the moss hat had
gathered there. The burning moss sizzles in the silence
of the catacombs, like angelic wailing or singing.
